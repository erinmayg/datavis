This is a user guide to use the [DFDR Data Visualisation App](https://erinmayg.github.io/datavis)

The app is built using React.js and [Apexcharts](https://github.com/apexcharts/react-apexcharts)

## Getting Started

### 1. Prepping the file
Please ensure that the file to be processed is an Excel Workbook (i.e. has a file extension of `.xls` or `.xlsx`). <br/>

The requirements for the data to be processed correctly is as follows:
- The first row of each Excel Sheet in the file is the name of the parameters
- There needs to be one time column in each Excel sheet with the format of `HH:mm:ss` _**or**_ `HH:mm` <br/>
  - In the event that there is no column that follows the given format, the X-axis displayed in the graph will simply be a numeric value from `1 ... n` where `n` is the number of data points.

### 2. Uploading the file
Click on the `Browse` button and choose a file to process.

### 3. Plotting the graphs
1. Choose a sheet to display the data from

4. Choose the columns to display in the graph

  </div>

  Icons inside the box are to add/remove columns <br/>
  Icons outside the box are to add/remove graphs

## Features
- Plot multiple parameters in the same graph

- Auto-differentiate colours

- Synced interaction across multiple graphs
  - Zooming
   
    Zooming is _independent_ across y-axis but _synced_ for x-axis (i.e. When zooming-in on a graph, the x-axis for all other graphs changes but the y-axis is only changed on the graph you're interacting with)

  - Panning 
  
    Move across the x-axis on all graphs

- Show table

  `Ctrl + Click` on any point in the graph to show the data points prior and post the clicked data point. <br/>
  You can modify the data points shown.

- Annotate on graph

  `Ctrl + Click` on any point in the graph to select the x and y values, type in the annotation and add it to the selected graph

- Resize graphs

  Click and drag on the selected icon (on the bottom right corner of each graph) to resize the graph

- Download graph

  Click the `Download PDF` button to download _**all**_ the graphs as one PDF file <br/>
  Alternatively, click the hamburger icon (the three lines) on the top left corner of each graph to download them individually as a `.png` file.
